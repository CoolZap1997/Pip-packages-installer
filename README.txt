This is a random code that I made which anyone can make,
which I am slightly proud of myself for.

All the requirements of pip packages you want to install should be written down line by line with or without version.

Eg. package_abc=12.5.0

Then run the python script and it will generate a shell script with the name pip3_install_packages.sh

Then run the command:
sh pip3_install_packages.sh

Your packages should be installed for you!
